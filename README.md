Arch Scripts
===========

This repo hold three scripts that are all a work in progress that can be used to install Arch linux to my specific taste/specification. 

### Content

The three scripts are fairly self-explanatory:

**1_LVBPhase.sh**

Is for the live boot phase and is the initial setup of the drive and the installation of the base system.

**2_rootPhase.sh**

Is for the root phase and the setting up of the user area (including the installation and configuration of a couple bits of s/w).

**3_userPhase.sh**

Is for the user phase and pertains to my personal working environment, mainly software installation and configuration files.

### Locality

These were originally in my [dotfiles](https://github.com/bodneyc/dotfiles) repo but I realised that the third script is the one responsible for cloning that repo and so I would either already have it and thereby have these scripts, or I would have to get the scripts alone and then clone the repo and duplicate the scripts.

### Disclaimer

These scripts for setting up Arch are far from complete and are very much so a work in progress; if anyone happens to find this repo and decides to just run them, I have no idea of outcome, most likely an error will be thrown in the first four commands or so. They do however work as a simplistic guide walking one through the commands in the correct (as far as the fact that it works) order for setting up my specific Arch, but as a clone-and-run script? No.
